Tasks todo:
1. Add visual states files using json.
2. Add manifest file for the visual state and phoneme associations, use json.
3. Update SignalAnalysis to support computing a DFT for only target frequencies.  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency we only need to care about 85hz to 255hz.
4. Update have a mechanisum for calculating DFTs asyncronusly, possibly via threading.

Optional tasks only try once above is done:
1. Add phonese and visual states for a tonal language, Manderin seems approeriate given 4 tones on vowels.
2. Add functionality to record audio with a microphone, generate the animation for the audio and play both back in realtime (async calculations will be needed).
