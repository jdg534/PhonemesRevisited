Tasks todo:
1. Add .wav phonemes for english and have CMake copy them to the build output directory as a post build step.
2. Update the submodules to include and XML or JSON parsing library.
3. Add visual states files using from from task 2.
4. Add manifest file for the visual state and phoneme associations, use format from task 2.
5. Update SignalAnalysis to support computing a DFT for only target frequencies.  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency we only need to care about 85hz to 255hz.
6. Update have a mechanisum for calculating DFTs asyncronusly, possibly via threading.

Optional tasks only try once above is done:
1. Add phonese and visual states for a tonal language, Manderin seems approeriate given 4 tones on vowels.
2. Add functionality to record audio with a microphone, generate the animation for the audio and play both back in realtime (async calculations will be needed).
